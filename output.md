**About**

This is part of a research project that aims to detect API documentation inconsistencies in GitHub repositories automatically. I am evaluating the validity of the approach by identifying such inconsistencies in real-world repositories. 

Hopefully, this is a step towards easier maintenance of API documentation. If you find this helpful, please consider updating the documentation to keep it in sync with the source code. I am also happy to assist with it, if appropriate. If this has not been useful, consider updating this issue with an explanation, so I can improve my approach. Thank you!
